<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p><strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong>It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I
    have read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>
<p>
    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
</p>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
</p>
<p>
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
